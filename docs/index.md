# HELLO
This is a roadmap for the implementation of the <b> Engagement Apps pipeline </b>, according to the Open Museum modular structure. <br>

### The design and tech documentaion here is intented to create a virtuos exchange of information for both humanists and computer science professionals. 4 main points are taken into consideration: <br>
- LIMITED YET COINCISE INFORMATION <br>
- PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT OF BOTH SIDES (HUMANISTIC AND TECHNOLOGY) <br>
- DISCOURSE AS A MEDIUM FOR INTERVENTION <br>
- PRAGMATIC EXPERIMENTATION <br>



## Combining knowledges
The Engagement Apps are the result of dialogues upon the Open Museum. We therefore invite you to take always into consideration the can we/should we trajectories to have meaningful conversations.
