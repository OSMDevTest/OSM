## Ethical Design Choices
Automated systems are typically engineered for swift decision-making, often without prioritizing user understanding of the decision-making process. However, there are instances where comprehension of automated decision-making becomes essential. <br>
Algorithms, being susceptible to errors and influenced by biased data, can lead to systematic discrimination. If the "engine bonnet" of the automated system isn't accessible, identifying errors and injustices becomes challenging. While only a select few may possess the expertise to understand the algorithms fully, transparency entails making these algorithms accessible and open to scrutiny by experts and legislators, advocating for the interests of the general populace.
