## Ethical Design Principles for AI integration

Automated systems are typically engineered for swift decision-making, often without prioritizing user understanding of the decision-making process. However, there are instances where comprehension of automated decision-making becomes essential. <br>
Algorithms, being susceptible to errors and influenced by biased data, can lead to systematic discrimination. If the "engine bonnet" of the automated system isn't accessible, identifying errors and injustices becomes challenging. While only a select few may possess the expertise to understand the algorithms fully, transparency entails making these algorithms accessible and open to scrutiny by experts and legislators, advocating for the interests of the general populace.

<br>
As automated systems increasingly take on decision-making roles, it becomes imperative for these systems to be designed with the capability to offer explanations for their decisions. However, determining when a system should provide self-explanations involves navigating ethical considerations. While this is crucial for decisions significantly impacting human life, many algorithmic decisions in practical scenarios might be trivial and routine, not warranting detailed explanations. For instance, an algorithm automatically turning off lights in a room may not necessitate an elaborate justification.

- Make it obvious to users that they are communicating with an automated system.
- Don’t design your automated system in a way that mimics human behavior (Chatting with a robot shouldn’t happen in the same interface as when chatting with a human).
- Make automated systems more mechanical (preserve the robot voice and rigid robotic language).
- Try to explain to the public how your automated systems make decisions.
- Make your algorithms open and accessible so that experts can “open the bonnet.”
- Engage experts to review your algorithms.
- Try to develop simple algorithms with humanly understandable logic.
- As much as possible, avoid black box systems where you do not even understand how the algorithms work.
- Always try to design algorithms that explain themselves while they’re being used.
- If possible, avoid black-box algorithms where an explanation is important.
- Always make sure through the digital design that users can request an explanation an algorithmic decision.
- Ultimately, one should always be able to get an explanation from a human being for an algorithmic decision.
- Make your algorithms open and accessible so that experts can “open the bonnet.”
- Invite experts to review your algorithms.
- Verify that machine learning data represents all the stakeholders that may be affected by the algorithm.
- Avoid having your digital solution automate existing and unwanted biases.
- Regularly check your algorithms for bias and preferably use independent experts for this.
- Make sure to have diversity in your development team to raise awareness of unwanted bias.
