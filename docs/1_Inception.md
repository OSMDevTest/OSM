## WHY - Historical sense-making
Research underscores the foundational role of one-to-one reciprocal interactions as the bedrock of trust, forming the basis for enduring connections in families, friendships, and love relationships. Extending beyond individual interactions, the intricate network of these engagements within a group, often referred to as 'social capital,' enhances the collective ability to act for the common welfare and ensures the group's resilience. In the digital age, the Open Museum's Engagement Apps serve as a contemporary manifestation of reciprocity, fostering trust and building bonds within a broader societal context. Through interactive and engaging experiences, these digital tools aim to scale the principles of reciprocity, strengthening the fabric of trust that holds society together in the face of technological advancements and evolving social dynamics.

## WHAT - Phigital Experience
An Engagement Application serves as a specialized digital tool intricately woven into the fabric of the Open Museum, actively involving visitors and enhancing their interaction with embedded Case Study Elements. Accessible through mobile devices, this application employs a diverse array of interactive features, multimedia content, and user-friendly interfaces to immerse museum visitors in a captivating and enriching experience. <b> The overarching objective of Engagement Applications is to inspire Open Museum visitors to delve into exploration, learning, and active contribution, thereby cultivating a more profound and participatory engagement with the museum's offerings. </b> <br> 

## HOW - Enacting Sense of Care
In terms of design, the approach adheres closely to the project's objectives, ensuring active engagement with curated narratives and artifacts to enhance the understanding and appreciation of cultural heritage. The development unfoldsin three distinct phases: PHASE I: Inception involves the creation of straightforward Weblets, designed to function without utilizing the onboard sensors of mobile phones. PHASE II: Evolution marks the design of more sophisticated Applets, leveraging the onboard sensors of mobile phones. The emphasis remains on simplicity, avoiding unnecessary complexities. PHASE III: Refinement incorporates insights gained from user studies, enabling adjustments to enhance the effectiveness of the apps. This phase introduces more immersive technologies and judicious use of sensors where needed, ensuring a seamless blend of innovation and user-centric design.

The concept of <b>plausibility</b> (i.e., the degree to which an idea seems believable) is one of the seven properties of sensemaking â€“ that leads us to put a strong accent in the use of <b>narratives</b> that would allow sense making, opening the path to the consecutive metacognition moment. A focus on the interaction between materiality and narratives helps scholars understand how organizations engage in authenticity work to maintain resonance with their audiences. <br>
Furthermore, the narrative will try to demystifying the objects we tend to take for granted, the attempt to facilitate change along aesthetic evolution and renewing styles, the expectations on vernacular materials and renewed proposal for the definition of inclusive design by incorporating other-than-humans.
