The development unfoldsin three distinct phases: PHASE I: Inception involves the creation of straightforward Weblets, designed to function without utilizing the onboard sensors of mobile phones. PHASE II: Evolution marks the design of more sophisticated Applets, leveraging the onboard sensors of mobile phones. The emphasis remains on simplicity, avoiding unnecessary complexities. PHASE III: Refinement incorporates insights gained from user studies, enabling adjustments to enhance the effectiveness of the apps. This phase introduces more immersive technologies and judicious use of sensors where needed, ensuring a seamless blend of innovation and user-centric design.  The concept of plausibility (i.e., the degree to which an idea seems believable) is one of the seven properties of sensemaking \u2013 that leads us to put a strong accent in the use of narratives that would allow sense making, opening the path to the consecutive metacognition moment. A focus on the interaction between materiality and narratives helps scholars understand how organizations engage in authenticity work to maintain resonance with their audiences.  Furthermore, the narrative will try to demystifying the objects we tend to take for granted, the attempt to facilitate change along aesthetic evolution and renewing styles, the expectations on vernacular materials and renewed proposal for the definition of inclusive design by incorporating other-than-humans.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"2_Participation/","title":"2: Inte(g)ration","text":"<p>See the board below to explore how sense of care and authenticity can be enacted through AI integration with Engagement Apps.
